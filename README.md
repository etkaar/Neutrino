# Neutrino
Neutrino is an encrypted and event-driven UDP based network protocol with focus on simplicity (as far this is possible which such a protocol) and high performance.

The idea for Neutrino initially came from [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) which is expected to replace TCP with encrypted UDP in HTTP/3. Due to the lack of implementations and the complexity of this protocol (and the lack of encryption in UDP) I decided to create a module based Neutrino, where in the basic version at least encrypted UDP can be provided, which is mandatory nowadays.

For better separation of concerns it comes in three different versions ‚Äì the basic version and two extensions:

- **Neutrino**<br>
  The basic protocol. Packets<sup>1</sup> are always encrypted and must have a size of <= 1280 bytes.
  
- **NeutrinoReliable**<br>
  An extension which introduces detection and correction of packet loss and detection of duplicates or packets which are out of order.
  
- **NeutrinoExtended**<br>
  Relies on NeutrinoReliable and raises the packet size limit.

<small><sup>1</sup> With the exception of the initial *PACKET_TYPE_CLIENT_HELLO1*.</small>

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
  - PyNaCl (libsodium / https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)

## 1.0 Public-Key Authentication
The packet payload and parts of the header (containing the packet number) are encrypted using [XChaCha20-Poly1305](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/secret-key_cryptography/aead/chacha20-poly1305/xchacha20-poly1305_construction). This functionality is provided by the easily portable libsodium project which is available in PHP and in Python via PyNaCl.

## 2.0 Packet Format

```lua
RAW_PACKET = (HEADER + PAYLOAD)
```

### 2.1 Header

The header consists of a left and right part. While the left part is unprotected, the right side ‚Äì which includes the packet number ‚Äì is protected.

```lua
HEADER(
   UNPROTECTED(
      [Protocol Identifier = u32 bit (4 bytes)]
      [Protocol Version = u8 bit (1 byte)]
      [Type = u8 bit (1)]
      [Session ID = u64 bit (8 bytes)]
   )

   ENCRYPTED(
      [Packet Number = u64 bit (8 bytes)]
      [Keyword: Reserved for arbitrary use = u32 bit (4)]
   )
)
```

### 2.2 Payload

#### 2.2.1 Neutrino + NeutrinoReliable

```lua
PAYLOAD(
   [Amount of Payload Words = u8 bit (1 byte)]
   for word_number_n=0 to [Amount of Payload Words]
   WORD_N(
      [Playload Word Size = u16 bit (2 bytes)]
      [Word = ? bytes]
   )
)
```

#### 2.2.1 NeutrinoExtended

```lua
PAYLOAD(
   [Amount of Payload Words = u16 bit (2 bytes)]
   for word_number_n=0 to [Amount of Payload Words]
   WORD_N(
      [Playload Word Size = u32 bit (4 bytes)]
      [Word = ? bytes]
   )
)
```

## 3.0 Code Styling
- Python
  - Type hints for class variables, but none for function variables.
  - Type hints for function arguments and return values.
